### Description

Restructuring the project directory to enable individual contributions without much pull and push merge conflicts.
This is necessary as new members are been added to the project which would require individuals working on smaller features.
It would allows smaller and reusable UI components that can be easily used in the entire application.
This would also enable components inheritance and would tries to minimize feature dependency as possible.


## Type of change

- [x] Restructuring of project directory

# How Has This Been Tested?

There would not be a need for testing as it just a directory restructuring. Just a pull from the dev and restructuring of files into directories.

- [x] Dev codes are running as earlier

# Checklist:

- [x] I have performed a self-review of the restructuring with some of the team members 
- [x] I have added documents and comments to the each directory
- [x] A tree structure of the app is shown below.
