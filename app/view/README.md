# About /view/

The `` app/view/ `` path conatins all the widgets(Icons, buttons, layout, etc) and re-usable components for the UI(screens). It consists of two main paths;

1. `` /commons/ `` : Put most frequently used widgets or components into this path and call it anywhere within your `` /screen/ ``
You may need to created a sub directory inside the `` /commons/ `` and place your re-usable components there

2. `` /screens/ `` : Your main screens goes into the path. Create a sub directory and place them in.
    for example `` /screens/login_screen/ `` then ``.py`` and ``.kv ``files into it.
